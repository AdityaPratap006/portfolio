                    I love building interactive web based applications.
                    Since my school days, I was always fascinated by all those web and mobile apps out there (which have revolutionized our lives) and wondered
                    how  they are built. I was determined to make Software Engineering as my career.

                    While building any application, my prime focus is on writing clean, reusable and robust code.
